*Presenting at a Machine Learning event in Barcelona*

I'm an engineer who dabbles in machine learning. My core interest is in energy systems and forecasting, however I'm most focused on building up the tools and skills to contribute to meaningfull projects. 

## Machine Learning and Modelling Projects

[**Short-Term Energy Demand Forecasting with Neural Networks**](https://github.com/nicholasjhana/short-term-energy-demand-forecasting)
Predicting the daily 24 hour ahead electrical load forecast in Spain. Models implemented SARIMA, Prophet, Long-Short Term Network

**Solving Sudoku with Computer Vision**
Given an unsolved Sudoku image, read the current board, solve the problem, and output an image of the solution

[**Ad-tech ETL pipeline with GCP**](https://github.com/nicholasjhana/gb-etl-nn)
Automated extraction and update daily ad-clicks/activity data. Transform and combine data with primary history file in google big query. Project link

[**Renewable energy supply techology techno-economic model**](bit.ly/2VvXjvW)
Investigation and modelling of energy efficiency & renewable supply technology in sustainable buildings: a case study of the Living Wall.
